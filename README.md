# CSCI-41-Project-2
For this project I was task to create sorting algorithms for arrays and vectors. From this I was always task to set a timer for the array and vector to test which one was the quickest to sort. I tested the project with a 1000000 integers. 


To start uncomment either the array section or the vector section in the main function of the code. The timer will run atomatically. The only output of the code will be a time in miliseconds on how long it took to sort all the numbers.
